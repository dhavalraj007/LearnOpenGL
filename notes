Learned about :
Textures
Tex coords
Sampling of texture
Texture Wrapping
Texture Filtering : defines stretegy for big objs and small res images (stretegy for scaling and downscaling : GL_NEAREST,GL_LINEAR )
Mipmaps : solves problem of small objs(respect to camera pos.) and high res images (thus only used when downscaling texture)
